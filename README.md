Inspired by the desire to quickly and easily create compelling data visualizations, Dash JS empowers its users to derive meaning from their data. Even non-technical users will find our light-weight dashboard interface to be simple and intuitive, reducing the barrier to entry for data analysis

Designing a dashboard can be done in a few simple steps:

**Upload** — Populate a dataset via a CSV / JSON file upload, or connect directly to our API to stream a set of records

**Create** — Build a new dashboard with a variety of charts, and customize it by moving and resizing charts, establishing links between widgets, changing the styles, etc

**Share** — Once created, users can share their dashboards with the community by publishing them to the Dashboard Stream
